Inheritance System with Deadman Switch + Yield

A blockchain-based digital will that automatically distributes assets to beneficiaries when the owner stops proving they're alive, while generating yield during the waiting period. Solves the "sudden death crypto loss" problem where billions in crypto are permanently lost because heirs don't have access.

Concrete Workflow

Initial Setup (The "Will Creation")

Owner deposits assets (ETH, tokens, NFTs)
Specifies 1-10 beneficiaries with percentage splits (e.g., spouse 50%, children 25% each)
Sets check-in frequency (e.g., every 90 days)
Defines vesting schedule per beneficiary:

Immediate: 100% released on inheritance trigger
Vesting: Released over time (e.g., 10% per year for 10 years)
Age-gated: Released when beneficiary reaches certain age


Appoints 2-3 "trusted contacts" who can verify death
Chooses yield strategy for funds while in contract


Active Phase (Owner Alive)

Owner must "check in" before deadline (sign transaction or send heartbeat)
If checked in: timer resets to full period (90 days)
Funds automatically deployed to yield generation
Owner can:

Withdraw funds anytime (it's still their money)
Add/remove beneficiaries
Adjust percentages
Change vesting schedules
Add more assets




Warning Phase (Missed Check-in) // Optional (requires setup)

Day 90: Automatic notification sent (email, SMS via oracle if configured)
Grace period begins (e.g., 30 additional days)
Trusted contacts receive alerts: "Please verify owner's status"
Day 120: If still no check-in, moves to Verification Phase


Verification Phase

Trusted contacts can submit death verification
Options:

Minimal: 2-of-3 trusted contacts confirm
Oracle-based: Submit death certificate hash for oracle verification
Challenge period: 30 days for owner to prove they're alive and override


If verified and no challenge: Moves to Distribution Phase


Distribution Phase

Assets automatically unlock according to vesting schedules
Immediate beneficiaries: Can withdraw their share now
Vesting beneficiaries: Funds enter time-locked vesting contract

Example: $100k over 10 years = $10k unlocks per year
Still earns yield during vesting


Age-gated beneficiaries: Funds held until age requirement met

Minor child: Locked until 18, then vesting begins
Can withdraw generated yield earlier (optional)




Ongoing Management (Post-Inheritance)

Vesting beneficiaries receive periodic unlocks
Yield continues generating on unvested portions
Beneficiaries can see countdown to next unlock
Optional: Beneficiary can accelerate vesting by burning a portion (e.g., get 50% now by forfeiting 10%)


Edge Cases Handled

False alarm: Owner returns, proves identity, reclaims full control
Dispute: Beneficiary challenges distribution → enters arbitration period
Partial death: One of multiple owners dies (joint accounts) → only their portion distributes
Lost keys: Trusted contacts can initialize process even without owner's missed check-in



Problems It Solves
Problem 1: Lost Crypto Inheritance ($100B+ Problem)

Issue: 4 million BTC (~$140B) estimated lost forever due to death/lost keys
Real cases:

Gerald Cotten (QuadrigaCX): $190M locked forever
Mircea Popescu: ~$2B potentially lost
Countless individuals: families can't access deceased's crypto


Solution: Automatic distribution to designated heirs without needing owner's private keys
How: Beneficiaries have separate keys; contract enforces distribution logic

Problem 2: Probate Process Delays & Costs

Issue: Traditional inheritance takes 6-24 months, costs 3-7% of estate value
Example: $500k estate → $15k-35k in legal fees, 12-month wait
Solution: Automated distribution in ~120 days (90 + 30 grace period)
Savings: Only gas fees (~$50-200), no lawyers required for execution

Problem 3: Will Contestation & Family Disputes

Issue: 60% of probate cases involve disputes; leads to years of litigation
Solution: Immutable distribution rules; can't be contested after setup
Transparency: All beneficiaries can see the rules from day one
No ambiguity: Smart contract executes exactly as programmed

Problem 4: Sudden Wealth Syndrome in Heirs

Issue: 70% of lottery winners and sudden inheritance recipients go broke within years
Research: Young inheritors often mismanage lump sums
Solution: Vesting schedules enforce gradual distribution
Example: $1M inheritance → $100k/year for 10 years prevents blow-out
Added safety: Funds still earn yield during vesting (beneficiary gets even more)

Problem 5: Minor Children as Beneficiaries

Issue: Can't give large sums to minors; requires court-appointed guardian
Solution: Age-gated releases with optional yield access
Example:

10-year-old inherits $200k
Can withdraw generated yield (~$1,000/month at 6% APY) for expenses
Principal locked until 18
Then vests over 5 years (25, 50, 75, 100% at ages 18, 21, 25, 30)



Problem 6: Inactive Account Detection

Issue: No standardized way to prove someone is alive in crypto
Solution: Regular check-ins create proof-of-life
Benefit: Owner stays engaged; heirs have certainty about process
Prevents: Assets locked forever in wallet no one can access

Target Use Cases

Crypto Holders with Families

Person with significant crypto holdings
Wants to ensure spouse/children inherit
Check in quarterly while alive
Death → automatic distribution with smart vesting


Business Owners with Digital Assets

NFT collections, token holdings, DeFi positions
Co-founder/business partner as trusted contact
Ensures business continuity
Vesting prevents market dump of large holdings


International Families

Beneficiaries in different countries
Traditional probate is nightmare across jurisdictions
Smart contract works globally
No currency conversion issues (distribute in crypto or stablecoins)


People with Complex Family Structures

Multiple marriages, stepchildren, diverse beneficiaries
Want clear, unambiguous distribution
Prevents family fighting
Each party can independently verify their allocation


Early Crypto Adopters (Large Holdings)

People with >$1M in crypto
Concerned about heirs' ability to manage sudden wealth
10-20 year vesting ensures responsible distribution
Yield generation continues growing wealth



Key Innovations

Active liveness proof: Owner must prove they're alive (vs. passive "if I die")
Graceful failure: Multiple verification layers prevent false triggers
Yield + inheritance: Dead capital becomes productive capital
Graduated distribution: Prevents beneficiary mismanagement
No key sharing: Owner never gives up control until actually needed
Crypto-native probate: Solves specifically for digital asset inheritance
